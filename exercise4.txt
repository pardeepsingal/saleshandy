I have 9+ years of expertise in Web development technology basically I worked in the different domain based on industry standards.
I have learned the new things in the each application related to the learning, documentation or 3rd parties.
My Previous work experience has mostly I worked in Education,Learning,Accidental Insurance,Healthcare,Security,
ecommerce,Banks,Financial etc

I would like to share the last application which has recent learning and debugging performed.

UTA Mentis Portal-

This application has basically many modules but I worked on new module (BlueSheet) besides of this I have handled the small team
when our project manager was on leave.

I have developed the front end module using the Backbone js, Underscore Js lib. and backend developed using the Zend framework.
I learn some new compression tools and the Most Important thing that I directly work under the CTO and I learned the many new tools and
different view of eyes for each software I worked on many things ER diagram, Sketch, Mockup designing and discussion with
the team on technical solution etc with the help of CTO,

What I like most-

Starting my presence in the documentation part and Mockup designing part was more than the development so I spent much
time on Atlassian tool for documents and zendesk for support ticket management.

Technical Solution-

We have 3rd Parties company that provides the API but their documentation not ready so they do communicate with us.So I have
communicated technically with their team and send them the samples to Provide us the solution accordingly.

New module designing-

I have designed the new custom module which has external tools used to Populate the 3rd parties results, Handle the multiple data
in single CRUD, Menu Bars, Zend namespace etc.

 Tools Used-

 PhpStorm IDE for development
 MYSQL Workbench for Database
 Mockup tools for design the sketch and flow
 Bitbucket for repository
 Atlassian for documentation
